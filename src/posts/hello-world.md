# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new blog! I've been looking for a simple, fast way to publish my thoughts and tutorials, and I think I've found it with mdBook.

## Why mdBook?

After trying various static site generators, I chose mdBook for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: No complex configuration or themes to wrestle with
2. **Speed**: Builds are lightning fast
3. **Search**: Built-in search functionality that just works
4. **Markdown-first**: Pure Markdown with minimal front matter

## What's Coming

I plan to write about:

- Web development best practices
- System design patterns
- Tool reviews and comparisons
- Programming tutorials

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of the kind of content you can expect:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
```

The syntax highlighting works great out of the box!

## Conclusion

This setup gives me everything I need: fast builds, clean URLs, responsive design, and RSS feeds. Perfect for a developer blog.

Stay tuned for more posts!
