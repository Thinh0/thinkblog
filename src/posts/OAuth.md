# OAuth (Open Authentication)

When I was hunting for my first co-op job, I had two major problems: no experience and lack of knowledge. From some of the job postings I saw, they mentioned about a thing called "OAuth". And I know, doing an overnight research on that won't help me land my co-op interviews. But after reading briefly about OAuth, I found it a bit interesting and think of sharing some of my finds and thoughts through this blog.

## The Origin of OAuth

The making of OAuth started around November 2006, when Blaine Cook (Twitter) was working on Twitter's OpenID implementation and needed a way to delegate API access. He then contacted Chris Messina and they met with David Recordon, Larry Halff (Ma.gnolia), and others at a CitizenSpace OpenID meeting.

Then in April 2007, a small group of implementers from Google wrote a proposal for an open protocol. Turned out, this was not only a problem to OpenID but also caught the attention of DeWitt Clinton from Google, he then expressed his interest in supporting the project, if only as a stakeholder. July 2007, the team drafted an initial specification and the group was open-to-join for anyone who have interests and want to contribute to the project. Finally, on October 3rd, 2007, the final draft OAuth Core 1.0 was released.
