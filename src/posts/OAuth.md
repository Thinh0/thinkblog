# OAuth (Open Authentication)

When I was hunting for my first co-op job, I had two major problems: no experience and lack of knowledge. From some of the job postings I saw, they mentioned about a thing called "OAuth". And I know, doing an overnight research on that won't help me land my co-op interviews. But after reading briefly about OAuth, I found it a bit interesting and think of sharing some of my finds and thoughts through this blog.

## The Origin of OAuth



## How Does It Work?



## OAuth vs. OAuth2.0



## Is This The Future For Web App?
